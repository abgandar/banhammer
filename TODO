Development:
- banhammer:  implement IP exclusion (exclude=IP option in config block)
- capsicum support for better security

Testing:
  * check WITHOUT_IPV6 to really be completely IPv6 free in ipfw3.c (i.e. compiles on IPv6 free systems)
  * check if it compiles and runs on FreeBSD 8 (without IPFW3)

Release Engineering:
- Website: update README-examples and reactivate
- Submit FreeBSD port
- Release after checking with original author


Long term stuff:
- banhammer: separate different regex codes into banlib
- banlib:
  * remove ipfw2 code once FreeBSD 8 is EOL
  * ipfw_add should really merge existing entry's value and new value, and
    update to the largest (or 0). Requires full table list to obtain existing
    entry's value due to lacking interface to query value.
