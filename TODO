Development:
- banhammer:  implement IP exclusion (exclude=IP option in config block)
- capsicum support for better security

Testing:
  * check WITHOUT_IPV6 to really be completely IPv6 free in ipfw3.c (i.e. compiles on IPv6 free systems)

Release Engineering:
- Website: update README-examples and reactivate
- Submit FreeBSD port

Long term stuff:
- banhammer: separate different regex codes into banlib
- banlib:
  * ipfw_add should really merge existing entry's value and new value, and
    update to the largest (or 0).
