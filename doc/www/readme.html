<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Installing banhammer is easiest using the FreeBSD port collection or the package
in security/banhammer. Just type "<code>pkg install security/banhammer</code>"
and you should be all set.</br>
Alternatively, to compile and install banhammer from source, unpack the source
code and follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li><code>./configure</code>
   <p>This will configure banhammer to build on your system.</p>

   <p><code>--with-pcre=[path]</code><br>build with PCRE library in path
     The default is to look for the PCRE library in the standard path on
     FreeBSD (<code>/usr/local</code>). If there is no PCRE library, banhammer 
     will be built using POSIX regular expressions from the system libraries 
     instead.</p>

   <p>If IPFW3 is available banhammer will use the new IPFW3 kernel interface,
    falling back to IPFW2 otherwise. If both IPFW3 and IPv6 are available,
    banhammer will also be automatically built with support for blocking IPv6
    addresses as well.</p>
</li>
<li><code>make</code>
<p>Will build the binaries.</p>
</li>
<li><code>make install</code>
<p>Installs the binaries into <code>$(PREFIX)/bin</code>, a sample configuration file 
into <code>$(PREFIX)/etc</code> and the startup script into <code>$(PREFIX)/etc/rc.d</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Once banhammer is installed in the system, you have to perform a few more
steps to set up banhammer in the system.
<ol>
<li>Copy the sample configuration file <code>banhammer.conf.sample</code> in <code>$(PREFIX)/etc</code>
to <code>banhammer.conf</code> and edit it to fit your needs.</li>
<li><p>Edit <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> and add an entry like this:<br/>
<code>auth.info;authpriv.info &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |exec /usr/local/bin/banhammer</code><br/>
Then restart syslogd (<code>service syslogd restart</code>).</p>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to enable banhammerd by adding the following lines, adjusting the 
IPFW table numbers as needed:<br/>
<code>banhammerd_enable = "YES"<br/>
banhammerd_tables = "1"</code><br/>
Then start banhammerd (<code>service banhammerd start</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, adjust your IPFW rules to block (or otherwise treat) packets from
addresses in your IPFW table. For example, you can execute<br/>
<code>ipfw add 100 deny ip from me to table\(1\)</br>
ipfw add 100 deny ip from table\(1\) to me</pre></code>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
The entire banhammer configuration is stored in a configuration file,
e.g. <code>banhammer.conf</code>.<br/>
This file contains several groups of regular expressions to match messages
from syslog against. Depending on the configuration options of each group,
expressions in the group that match add an IP address to an IPFW table.
The IP address to add is determined from either a regular expression match
named "host" (only available if compiled with PCRE) or from the first match
found in the regular expression. The match can either be the DNS name of the
host to block, or an IPv4 address.</p>

<p>Groups are defined by a line with comma separated group parameters enclosed
in <code>[ ]</code>. For details of the group options, see the <a href="man.html">
man page</a>.<br/>
The group definition is then followed by the regular expressions in the group,
each one on a separate line.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Warning</i>: When legitimate users enter a wrong password, some ssh clients will 
         try several authentication methods, causing several failures. Thus
         one wrong user password may trigger several hits. Consider this
         when choosing a value for "count".

<h3>Banhammer</h3>
<p>Matching lines such as:</p>

<p>
<pre style="overflow: scroll; background: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid lightgray;">
Jan  1 00:00:00 hostname banhammer[78809]: Added 1.2.3.4 to IPFW table 1 for 887 seconds.
Jan  1 00:00:00 hostname banhammer[8309]: Added 1.2.3.4 to IPFW table 2.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This is a useful set of rules to permanently block repeat offenders
by monitoring banhammer's very own output to identify blocked IPs.
For this to work you need to also redirect security.* messages to
banhammer in your /etc/syslogd.conf.
</p>

<p>
<pre style="overflow: scroll; background: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid lightgray;">
[table=1,within=120,count=2,reset=1000]

^.{15} [^ ]* banhammer\[[[:digit:]]+\]: Added ([[:digit:].]+) to IPFW table [[:digit:]]+ for [[:digit:]]+ seconds\.$

<h2>Configuration tips &amp; tricks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some useful POSIX pattern to match IPs and hostnames with reasonable accuracy:
<pre>
   PATTERN                     MATCHES
([[:digit:].]+)                IP4
([[:xdigit:]:]+)               IP6
([[:xdigit:]:.]+)              IP4, IP6
([[:alnum:].-]+)               IP4, host name
([[:alnum:]:.-]+)              IP4, IP6, host name
</pre>
</li>

<li>Note that all hit counting happens within a group only. That is, a host that
matches some regular expression in the first group, and then later in another
group, will be counted as two separate hosts. The hits in the first group do
not count towards the limit of the second group and vice versa.<br/>
Hits by different regular expressions of the same group for a host, however,
are counted towards the total hit count of that host.</li>

<li>Groups allow the separation of blocking rules for different services,
with fine grained control over the blocking actions to be taken.</li>

<li>The maxhosts and maxaction settings can be used to protect against DDOS
attacks. Instead of keeping track of every host that triggers one of the
regular expressions, and giving each one &lt;count&gt; tries, only the first
&lt;maxhosts&gt; hosts are watched.<br/>
By blocking all further hosts right away, flooding or DDOS attacks are
stopped at the earliest possible level by the IPFW firewall, before even
reaching the application under attack.</li>

<li>The warn setting can be used to prevent clobbering of the syslog if banhammer
is used for more than just blocking hosts. For example, certain hosts may
just be redirected through some traffic shaping pipes to limit their band-
width, instead of blocking them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>
<b>Q:</b> I'm using the PF/IPF/... firewall, can I still use banhammer?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Currently banhammer does not support any other firewall besides IPFW,
   but you can use pf and ipfw together without any problems.
   Create an ipfw ruleset like this:</p>

<p>
<pre>ipfw add 10 deny ip from table\(1\) to any
ipfw add 10 deny ip from any to table\(1\)
ipfw add 20 allow all from any to any</pre>
</p>

<p>This causes all incoming packets will be checked by ipfw and if they were not 
rejected, they will then be sent through pf.</p>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> I want to build my own regular expressions, how can I do this?<br/>
<b>A:</b> banhammer uses either PCRE or POSIX regular expressions for the regular
   expressions handling, depending on how you compiled it.<br/>
   Read the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt">PCRE documentation</a> or
   the POSIX regular expression description in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=re_format">re_format(7)</a>.<br/>
   You need to build a regexp which matches log lines with brute force attempts.
   The first found match must match either the remote IP address or a host name.
   If you are using PCRE, instead of using the first match you can have a named
   match called "host" that specifies the IP address or the host name.<br/>
   You can test your regexp with "pcretest" utility from the PCRE distribution.
   See the example configuration file for some hints on how to construct your 
   regular expressions.
