Q: I'm using the PF/IPF firewall, can I still use banhammer?
A: Currently banhammer does not support any other firewall besides IPFW, but
   you can use pf and ipfw together without any problems.
   Create an ipfw ruleset like this:

   ipfw add 10 deny ip from table\(1\) to any
   ipfw add 10 deny ip from any to table\(1\)
   ipfw add 20 allow all from any to any

   and all incoming packets will be checked by ipfw and if they were not 
   rejected, they will then be sent through pf.

Q: I want to build my own regular expressions, how can I do this?
A: banhammer uses either PCRE or POSIX regular expressions for the regular
   expressions handling, depending on how you compiled it.
   You can find the PCRE documentation located at http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt
   or at pcresyntax(3).The POSIX regular expression description can be found in 
   re_format(7).
   You need to build a regexp which matches log lines with brute force attempts.
   The first found match must match either the remote IP address or a host name.
   If you are using PCRE, instead of using the first match you can have a named
   match called "host" that specifies the IP address or the host name.
   You can test your regexp with "pcretest" utility from the PCRE distribution.
   See the example configuration file and the security section of banhamer(8)
   for some hints on how to construct safe regular expressions.
