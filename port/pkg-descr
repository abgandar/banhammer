Banhammer allows system administrators to block various bruteforce
attacks on UNIX services. The program analyzes system logs and adds
attacker's IP addresses to IPFW tables.
Addresses are automatically expunged from the tables after a specified
amount of time. Banhammer uses regular expressions to parse logs,
which provides flexibility allowing it to be used with almost any
network service.  Banhammer is written entirely in C, doesn't rely on any
external programs or libraries, and works with IPFW2.
